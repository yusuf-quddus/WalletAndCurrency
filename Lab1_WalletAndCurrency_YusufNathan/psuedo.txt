// CIS 22C #02Y
// Lab 1: Allows user to interact with the currencies in their wallet
// Name: Nathan Wong and Yusuf Quddus

/*
Program Code (Pseudocode):
Prompts user to enter in the 5 currencies that they have in their wallet.
Prints a menu for the user to add, subtract, display, empty, or check if their wallet is empty.

If the user types 1 (add):
    Prompts the user to input the values they want to add as well as the type of currency. The program then tells
    the user what has been added to their wallet. 
If the user types 2 (subtract):
    Prompts the user to input the values they want to subtract as well as the type of currency. The program then tells
    the user what has been subtracted from their wallet. If they don't have the money in their wallet, the program will 
    instead tell them that they do not have the necessary funds.
If the user types 3 (display):
    Prompts the user to what currency they would like to display. They can also display their entire wallet. After the user 
    makes a choice, the program will print the information based on what they chose.
If the user types 4 (empty):

If the user types 5 (if empty):
    Prompts the user to what currency they would like to check. After the user makes a choice, the program will tell the user
    if their chosen currency is empty or not. 
If the user types 6 (Exit):
    The program will exit and thank the user for using the program.
